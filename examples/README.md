# Example workspace

This folder contains an example workspace showing some use cases of edo. In time this will be expanded out with more complicated examples.

## hello_rust
This example shows how to use cargo vendor and then build in offline mode a rust crate

## hello_oci
This example is intended to show how to use a container environment

__NOTE: this example is currently broken due to a bug in the container environment where the gcc image environment is not being fully loaded into podman correctly.__
